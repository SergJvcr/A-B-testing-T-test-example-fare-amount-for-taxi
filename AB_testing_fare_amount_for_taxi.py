# We can conclude that there is a statistically significant difference

# The key business insight is that encouraging customers to pay 
# with credit cards can generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers.
# This project requires an assumption that passengers were forced to pay one way or the other, 
# and that once informed of this requirement, they always complied with it. 
# The data was not collected this way; so, an assumption had to be made to randomly group data 
# entries to perform an A/B test. This dataset does not account for other likely explanations. 
# For example, riders might not carry lots of cash, so it's easier to pay for longer/farther trips 
# with a credit card. In other words, it's far more likely that fare amount determines payment type, rather than vice versa.
